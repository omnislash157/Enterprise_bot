Hi-Lo operators support the overall productivity of the warehouse and directly impact on the speed and success of the night operations.\n\nNight shift hi-lo operators typically begin at 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM and work until all necessary replenishment and retrieval tasks are completed, usually around 4:00 AM.\n\nShift Schedule and Breaks\n\nHi-Lo operators follow the standard night shift break schedule:\n\nTwo 15-minute breaks\n\nOne 30-minute lunch break\n\nBreaks may not be taken in the machine room or on the warehouse floor.\n\nRole and Responsibilities\n\nAs a Hi-Lo Operator, you are responsible for replenishing products, retrieving cases or pallets that are out of reach, and supporting pickers so they can maintain their productivity and meet company goals.\n\nCore responsibilities include:\n\nOperating the Hi-Lo machine safely and efficiently throughout the warehouse.\n\nBringing products down from higher slots so pickers can access it.\n\nReplenishing products into empty or low slots to maintain stock availability.\n\nVisiting the clerks regularly to obtain short sheets\u2014lists of items that pickers could not find or mark as missing.\n\nSearching for and retrieving these \u201cshort\u201d items, which may be ghost pallets or misplaced cases.\n\nFinding and assigning proper substitutions in the system when required.\n\nScanning each slot and updating counts to keep the system\u2019s inventory accurate.\n\nCommunicating with pickers, clerks, and supervisors to ensure smooth workflow.\n\nEfficiency and Teamwork\n\nThis position is essential for keeping the warehouse floor moving efficiently.\n\nPickers rely on Hi-Lo operators to bring down products promptly.\n\nThe speed and accuracy of a Hi-Lo operator affect not only their own productivity but also that of the picking team.\n\nBeing proactive and organized helps prevent delays and keeps the shift on schedule.",
