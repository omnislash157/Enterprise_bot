# Run large and small language models with llama.cpp (DeepSeek-R1, Phi-4)

This example demonstrates how to run small (Phi-4) and large (DeepSeek-R1)
language models on Modal with [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).

By default, this example uses DeepSeek-R1 to produce a “Flappy Bird” game in Python —
see the video below. The code used in the video is [here](https://gist.github.com/charlesfrye/a3788c61019c32cb7947f4f5b1c04818),
along with the model’s raw outputs.
Note that getting the game to run required a small bugfix from a human —
our jobs are still safe, for now.

## What GPU can run DeepSeek-R1? What GPU can run Phi-4?

Our large model is a real whale: [DeepSeek-R1](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120),
which has 671B total parameters and so consumes over 100GB of storage,
even when [quantized down to one ternary digit (1.58 bits)](https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic) per parameter.

To make sure we have enough room for it and its activations/KV cache,
we select four L40S GPUs, which together have 192 GB of memory.

[Phi-4](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4),
on the other hand, is a svelte 14B total parameters,
or roughly 5 GB when quantized down to [two bits per parameter](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/phi-4-GGUF).

That’s small enough that it can be comfortably run on a CPU,
especially for a single-user setup like the one we’ll build here.

```shiki
GPU_CONFIG = "L40S:4" # for DeepSeek-R1, literal `None` for phi-4
```

 

Copy

 

To start, we define our `main` function —
the Python function that we’ll run locally to
trigger our inference to run on Modal’s cloud infrastructure.

This function, like the others that form our inference service
running on Modal, is part of a Modal [App](https://modal.com/docs/guide/apps).
Specifically, it is a `local_entrypoint`.
Any Python code can call Modal Functions remotely,
but local entrypoints get a command-line interface for free.

```shiki
app = modal.App("example-llama-cpp")

@app.local_entrypoint()
def main(
 prompt: Optional[str] = None,
 model: str = "DeepSeek-R1", # or "phi-4"
 n_predict: int = -1, # max number of tokens to predict, -1 is infinite
 args: Optional[str] = None, # string of arguments to pass to llama.cpp's cli
):
 """Run llama.cpp inference on Modal for phi-4 or deepseek r1."""
 import shlex

 org_name = "unsloth"
 # two sample models: the diminutive phi-4 and the chonky deepseek r1
 if model.lower() == "phi-4":
 model_name = "phi-4-GGUF"
 quant = "Q2_K"
 model_entrypoint_file = f"phi-4-{quant}.gguf"
 model_pattern = f"*{quant}*"
 revision = None
 parsed_args = DEFAULT_PHI_ARGS if args is None else shlex.split(args)
 elif model.lower() == "deepseek-r1":
 model_name = "DeepSeek-R1-GGUF"
 quant = "UD-IQ1_S"
 model_entrypoint_file = (
 f"{model}-{quant}/DeepSeek-R1-{quant}-00001-of-00003.gguf"
 )
 model_pattern = f"*{quant}*"
 revision = "02656f62d2aa9da4d3f0cdb34c341d30dd87c3b6"
 parsed_args = DEFAULT_DEEPSEEK_R1_ARGS if args is None else shlex.split(args)
 else:
 raise ValueError(f"Unknown model {model}")

 repo_id = f"{org_name}/{model_name}"
 download_model.remote(repo_id, [model_pattern], revision)

 # call out to a `.remote` Function on Modal for inference
 result = llama_cpp_inference.remote(
 model_entrypoint_file,
 prompt,
 n_predict,
 parsed_args,
 store_output=model.lower() == "deepseek-r1",
 )
 output_path = Path("/tmp") / f"llama-cpp-{model}.txt"
 output_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
 print(f"🦙 writing response to {output_path}")
 output_path.write_text(result)
```

 

Copy

You can trigger inference from the command line with

```shiki
modal run llama_cpp.py
```

 

Copy

To try out Phi-4 instead, use the `--model` argument:

```shiki
modal run llama_cpp.py --model="phi-4"
```

 

Copy

Note that this will run for up to 30 minutes, which costs ~$5.
To allow it to proceed even if your local terminal fails,
add the `--detach` flag after `modal run`.
See below for details on getting the outputs.

You can pass prompts with the `--prompt` argument and set the maximum number of tokens
with the `--n-predict` argument.

Additional arguments for `llama-cli` are passed as a string like `--args="--foo 1 --bar"`.

For convenience, we set a number of sensible defaults for DeepSeek-R1,
following the suggestions by the team at unsloth,
who [quantized the model to 1.58 bit](https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic).

```shiki
DEFAULT_DEEPSEEK_R1_ARGS = [ # good default llama.cpp cli args for deepseek-r1
 "--cache-type-k",
 "q4_0",
 "--threads",
 "12",
 "-no-cnv",
 "--prio",
 "2",
 "--temp",
 "0.6",
 "--ctx-size",
 "8192",
]

DEFAULT_PHI_ARGS = [ # good default llama.cpp cli args for phi-4
 "--threads",
 "16",
 "-no-cnv",
 "--ctx-size",
 "16384",
]
```

## Compiling llama.cpp with CUDA support

In order to run inference, we need the model’s weights
and we need code to run inference with those weights.

[`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is a no-frills C++ library for running large language models.
It supports highly-quantized versions of models ideal for running
single-user language modeling services on CPU or GPU.

We compile it, with CUDA support, and add it to a Modal [container image](https://modal.com/docs/guide/images) using the code below.

For more details on using CUDA on Modal, including why
we need to use the `nvidia/cuda` registry image in this case
(hint: it’s for the [`nvcc` compiler](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/host-software/nvcc)),
see the [Modal guide to using CUDA](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cuda).

```shiki
LLAMA_CPP_RELEASE = "b4568"
MINUTES = 60

cuda_version = "12.4.0" # should be no greater than host CUDA version
flavor = "devel" # includes full CUDA toolkit
operating_sys = "ubuntu22.04"
tag = f"{cuda_version}-{flavor}-{operating_sys}"

image = (
 modal.Image.from_registry(f"nvidia/cuda:{tag}", add_python="3.12")
 .apt_install("git", "build-essential", "cmake", "curl", "libcurl4-openssl-dev")
 .run_commands("git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp")
 .run_commands(
 "cmake llama.cpp -B llama.cpp/build "
 "-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DLLAMA_CURL=ON "
 )
 .run_commands( # this one takes a few minutes!
 "cmake --build llama.cpp/build --config Release -j --clean-first --target llama-quantize llama-cli"
 )
 .run_commands("cp llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-* llama.cpp")
 .entrypoint([]) # remove NVIDIA base container entrypoint
)
```

 

Copy

 

To make the model weights available on Modal,
we download them from Hugging Face.

Modal is serverless, so disks are by default ephemeral.
To make sure our weights don’t disappear between runs,
which would trigger a long download, we store them in a
Modal [Volume](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes).

For more on how to use Modal Volumes to store model weights,
see [this guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/model-weights).

```shiki
model_cache = modal.Volume.from_name("llamacpp-cache", create_if_missing=True)
cache_dir = "/root/.cache/llama.cpp"

download_image = (
 modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.11")
 .uv_pip_install("huggingface-hub==0.36.0")
 .env({"HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE": "1"})
)

@app.function(
 image=download_image, volumes={cache_dir: model_cache}, timeout=30 * MINUTES
)
def download_model(repo_id, allow_patterns, revision: Optional[str] = None):
 from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

 print(f"🦙 downloading model from {repo_id} if not present")

 snapshot_download(
 repo_id=repo_id,
 revision=revision,
 local_dir=cache_dir,
 allow_patterns=allow_patterns,
 )

 model_cache.commit() # ensure other Modal Functions can see our writes before we quit

 print("🦙 model loaded")
```

 

Copy

 

Contemporary large reasoning models are slow —
for the sample “flappy bird” prompt we provide,
results are sometimes produced only after several (or even tens of) minutes.

That makes their outputs worth storing.
In addition to sending them back to clients,
like our local command line,
we’ll store the results on a Modal Volume for safe-keeping.

```shiki
results = modal.Volume.from_name("llamacpp-results", create_if_missing=True)
results_dir = "/root/results"
```

 

Copy

You can retrieve the results later in a number of ways.

You can use the Volume CLI:

```shiki
modal volume ls llamacpp-results
```

 

Copy

You can attach the Volume to a Modal `shell` to poke around in a familiar terminal environment:

```shiki
modal shell --volume llamacpp-results
# then cd into /mnt
```

 

Copy

Or you can access it from any other Python environment
by using the same `modal.Volume` call as above to instantiate it:

```shiki
results = modal.Volume.from_name("llamacpp-results")
print(dir(results)) # show methods
```

 

Copy

 

Now, let’s put it all together.

At the top of our `llama_cpp_inference` function,
we add an `app.function` decorator to attach all of our infrastructure:

- the `image` with the dependencies
- the `volumes` with the weights and where we can put outputs
- the `gpu` we want, if any

We also specify a `timeout` after which to cancel the run.

Inside the function, we call the `llama.cpp` CLI
with `subprocess.Popen`. This requires a bit of extra ceremony
because we want to both show the output as we run
and store the output to save and return to the local caller.
For details, see the [Addenda section](#addenda) below.

Alternatively, you might set up an OpenAI-compatible server
using base `llama.cpp` or its [Python wrapper library](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) along with one of [Modal’s decorators for web hosting](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks).

```shiki
@app.function(
 image=image,
 volumes={cache_dir: model_cache, results_dir: results},
 gpu=GPU_CONFIG,
 timeout=30 * MINUTES,
)
def llama_cpp_inference(
 model_entrypoint_file: str,
 prompt: Optional[str] = None,
 n_predict: int = -1,
 args: Optional[list[str]] = None,
 store_output: bool = True,
):
 import subprocess
 from uuid import uuid4

 if prompt is None:
 prompt = DEFAULT_PROMPT # see end of file
 if "deepseek" in model_entrypoint_file.lower():
 prompt = "<｜User｜>" + prompt + "<think>"
 if args is None:
 args = []

 # set layers to "off-load to", aka run on, GPU
 if GPU_CONFIG is not None:
 n_gpu_layers = 9999 # all
 else:
 n_gpu_layers = 0

 if store_output:
 result_id = str(uuid4())
 print(f"🦙 running inference with id:{result_id}")

 command = [
 "/llama.cpp/llama-cli",
 "--model",
 f"{cache_dir}/{model_entrypoint_file}",
 "--n-gpu-layers",
 str(n_gpu_layers),
 "--prompt",
 prompt,
 "--n-predict",
 str(n_predict),
 ] + args

 print("🦙 running command:", command, sep="\n\t")
 p = subprocess.Popen(
 command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=False
 )

 stdout, stderr = collect_output(p)

 if p.returncode != 0:
 raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(p.returncode, command, stdout, stderr)

 if store_output: # save results to a Modal Volume if requested
 print(f"🦙 saving results for {result_id}")
 result_dir = Path(results_dir) / result_id
 result_dir.mkdir(
 parents=True,
 )
 (result_dir / "out.txt").write_text(stdout)
 (result_dir / "err.txt").write_text(stderr)

 return stdout
```

# Addenda

The remainder of this code is less interesting from the perspective
of running LLM inference on Modal but necessary for the code to run.

For example, it includes the default “Flappy Bird in Python” prompt included in [unsloth’s announcement](https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic) of their 1.58 bit quantization of DeepSeek-R1.

```shiki
DEFAULT_PROMPT = """Create a Flappy Bird game in Python. You must include these things:

 You must use pygame.
 The background color should be randomly chosen and is a light shade. Start with a light blue color.
 Pressing SPACE multiple times will accelerate the bird.
 The bird's shape should be randomly chosen as a square, circle or triangle. The color should be randomly chosen as a dark color.
 Place on the bottom some land colored as dark brown or yellow chosen randomly.
 Make a score shown on the top right side. Increment if you pass pipes and don't hit them.
 Make randomly spaced pipes with enough space. Color them randomly as dark green or light brown or a dark gray shade.
 When you lose, show the best score. Make the text inside the screen. Pressing q or Esc will quit the game. Restarting is pressing SPACE again.

The final game should be inside a markdown section in Python. Check your code for errors and fix them before the final markdown section."""

def stream_output(stream, queue, write_stream):
 """Reads lines from a stream and writes to a queue and a write stream."""
 for line in iter(stream.readline, b""):
 line = line.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")
 write_stream.write(line)
 write_stream.flush()
 queue.put(line)
 stream.close()

def collect_output(process):
 """Collect up the stdout and stderr of a process while still streaming it out."""
 import sys
 from queue import Queue
 from threading import Thread

 stdout_queue = Queue()
 stderr_queue = Queue()

 stdout_thread = Thread(
 target=stream_output, args=(process.stdout, stdout_queue, sys.stdout)
 )
 stderr_thread = Thread(
 target=stream_output, args=(process.stderr, stderr_queue, sys.stderr)
 )
 stdout_thread.start()
 stderr_thread.start()

 stdout_thread.join()
 stderr_thread.join()
 process.wait()

 stdout_collected = "".join(stdout_queue.queue)
 stderr_collected = "".join(stderr_queue.queue)

 return stdout_collected, stderr_collected
