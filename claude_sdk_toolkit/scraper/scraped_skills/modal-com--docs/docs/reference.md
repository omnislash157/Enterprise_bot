# API Reference

This is the API reference for the [`modal`](https://pypi.org/project/modal/) Python package, which allows you to run distributed applications on Modal.

The reference is intended to be limited to low-level descriptions of various
programmatic functionality. If you’re just getting started with Modal, we would
instead recommend looking at the [guide](/docs/guide) first
or to get started quickly with an [example](/docs/examples).

## Application construction

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`App`](/docs/reference/modal.App) | The main unit of deployment for code on Modal |
| [`App.function`](/docs/reference/modal.App#function) | Decorator for registering a function with an App |
| [`App.cls`](/docs/reference/modal.App#cls) | Decorator for registering a class with an App |

 

## Serverless execution

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`Function`](/docs/reference/modal.Function) | A serverless function backed by an autoscaling container pool |
| [`Cls`](/docs/reference/modal.Cls) | A serverless class supporting parametrization and lifecycle hooks |

 

## Extended Function configuration

 

### Class parametrization

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`parameter`](/docs/reference/modal.parameter) | Used to define class parameters, akin to a Dataclass field |

 

### Lifecycle hooks

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`enter`](/docs/reference/modal.enter) | Decorator for a method that will be executed during container startup |
| [`exit`](/docs/reference/modal.exit) | Decorator for a method that will be executed during container shutdown |
| [`method`](/docs/reference/modal.method) | Decorator for exposing a method as an invokable function |

 

### Web integrations

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`fastapi_endpoint`](/docs/reference/modal.fastapi_endpoint) | Decorator for exposing a simple FastAPI-based endpoint |
| [`asgi_app`](/docs/reference/modal.asgi_app) | Decorator for functions that construct an ASGI web application |
| [`wsgi_app`](/docs/reference/modal.wsgi_app) | Decorator for functions that construct a WSGI web application |
| [`web_server`](/docs/reference/modal.web_server) | Decorator for functions that construct an HTTP web server |

 

### Function semantics

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`batched`](/docs/reference/modal.batched) | Decorator that enables [dynamic input batching](/docs/guide/dynamic-batching) |
| [`concurrent`](/docs/reference/modal.concurrent) | Decorator that enables [input concurrency](/docs/guide/concurrent-inputs) |

 

### Scheduling

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`Cron`](/docs/reference/modal.Cron) | A schedule that runs based on cron syntax |
| [`Period`](/docs/reference/modal.Period) | A schedule that runs at a fixed interval |

 

### Exception handling

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`Retries`](/docs/reference/modal.Retries) | Function retry policy for input failures |

 

## Sandboxed execution

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`Sandbox`](/docs/reference/modal.Sandbox) | An interface for restricted code execution |
| [`ContainerProcess`](/docs/reference/modal.container_process#modalcontainer_processcontainerprocess) | An object representing a sandboxed process |
| [`FileIO`](/docs/reference/modal.file_io#modalfile_iofileio) | A handle for a file in the Sandbox filesystem |

 

## Container configuration

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`Image`](/docs/reference/modal.Image) | An API for specifying container images |
| [`Secret`](/docs/reference/modal.Secret) | A pointer to secrets that will be exposed as environment variables |

 

## Data primitives

 

### Persistent storage

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`Volume`](/docs/reference/modal.Volume) | Distributed storage supporting highly performant parallel reads |
| [`CloudBucketMount`](/docs/reference/modal.CloudBucketMount) | Storage backed by a third-party cloud bucket (S3, etc.) |
| [`NetworkFileSystem`](/docs/reference/modal.NetworkFileSystem) | Shared, writeable cloud storage (superseded by `modal.Volume`) |

 

### In-memory storage

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`Dict`](/docs/reference/modal.Dict) | A distributed key-value store |
| [`Queue`](/docs/reference/modal.Queue) | A distributed FIFO queue |

 

## Networking

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`Proxy`](/docs/reference/modal.Proxy) | An object that provides a static outbound IP address for containers |
| [`forward`](/docs/reference/modal.forward) | A context manager for publicly exposing a port from a container |
