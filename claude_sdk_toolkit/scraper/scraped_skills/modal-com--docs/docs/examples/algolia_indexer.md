# Algolia docsearch crawler

This tutorial shows you how to use Modal to run the [Algolia docsearch
crawler](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/run-your-own/) to index your
website and make it searchable. This is not just example code - we run the same
code in production to power search on this page (`Ctrl+K` to try it out!).

## Basic setup

Let’s get the imports out of the way.

```shiki
import json
import os
import subprocess

import modal
```

 

Copy

Modal lets you [use and extend existing Docker images](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container#use-an-existing-container-image-with-from_registry),
as long as they have `python` and `pip` available. We’ll use the official crawler image built by Algolia, with a small
adjustment: since this image has `python` symlinked to `python3.6` and Modal is not compatible with Python 3.6, we
install Python 3.11 and symlink that as the `python` executable instead.

```shiki
algolia_image = modal.Image.from_registry(
 "algolia/docsearch-scraper:v1.16.0",
 add_python="3.11",
 setup_dockerfile_commands=["ENTRYPOINT []"],
)

app = modal.App("example-algolia-indexer")
```

 

Copy

 

## Configure the crawler

Now, let’s configure the crawler with the website we want to index, and which
CSS selectors we want to scrape. Complete documentation for crawler configuration is available [here](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/config-file).

```shiki
CONFIG = {
 "index_name": "modal_docs",
 "custom_settings": {
 "separatorsToIndex": "._",
 "synonyms": [["cls", "class"]],
 },
 "stop_urls": [
 "https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Stub",
 "https://modal.com/gpu-glossary",
 "https://modal.com/docs/reference/changelog",
 ],
 "start_urls": [
 {
 "url": "https://modal.com/docs/guide",
 "selectors_key": "default",
 "page_rank": 2,
 },
 {
 "url": "https://modal.com/docs/examples",
 "selectors_key": "examples",
 "page_rank": 1,
 },
 {
 "url": "https://modal.com/docs/reference",
 "selectors_key": "reference",
 "page_rank": 1,
 },
 ],
 "selectors": {
 "default": {
 "lvl0": {
 "selector": "header .navlink-active",
 "global": True,
 },
 "lvl1": "article h1",
 "lvl2": "article h2",
 "lvl3": "article h3",
 "text": "article p,article ol,article ul",
 },
 "examples": {
 "lvl0": {
 "selector": "header .navlink-active",
 "global": True,
 },
 "lvl1": "article h1",
 "text": "article p,article ol,article ul",
 },
 "reference": {
 "lvl0": {
 "selector": "//div[contains(@class, 'sidebar')]//a[contains(@class, 'active')]//preceding::a[contains(@class, 'header')][1]",
 "type": "xpath",
 "global": True,
 "default_value": "",
 "skip": {"when": {"value": ""}},
 },
 "lvl1": "article h1",
 "lvl2": "article h2",
 "lvl3": "article h3",
 "text": "article p,article ol,article ul",
 },
 },
}
```

## Create an API key

If you don’t already have one, sign up for an account on [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Set up
a project and create an API key with `write` access to your index, and with the ACL permissions `addObject`, `editSettings` and `deleteIndex`. Now, create a Secret on the Modal [Secrets](https://modal.com/secrets) page with the `API_KEY` and `APPLICATION_ID` you just created. You can name this anything you want,
but we named it `algolia-secret` and so that’s what the code below expects.

## The actual function

We want to trigger our crawler from our CI/CD pipeline, so we’re serving it as a [web endpoint](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks) that can be triggered by a `GET` request during deploy.
You could also consider running the crawler on a [schedule](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cron).

The Algolia crawler is written for Python 3.6 and needs to run in the `pipenv` created for it,
so we’re invoking it using a subprocess.

```shiki
@app.function(
 image=algolia_image,
 secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("algolia-secret")],
)
def crawl():
 # Installed with a 3.6 venv; Python 3.6 is unsupported by Modal, so use a subprocess instead.
 subprocess.run(
 ["pipenv", "run", "python", "-m", "src.index"],
 env={**os.environ, "CONFIG": json.dumps(CONFIG)},
 )
```

 

Copy

We want to be able to trigger this function through a webhook.

```shiki
@app.function(image=modal.Image.debian_slim().uv_pip_install("fastapi[standard]"))
@modal.fastapi_endpoint()
def crawl_webhook():
 crawl.remote()
 return "Finished indexing docs"
```

 

Copy

 

## Deploy the indexer

That’s all the code we need! To deploy your application, run

```shiki
modal deploy algolia_indexer.py
```

 

Copy

If successful, this will print a URL for your new webhook, that you can hit using `curl` or a browser. Logs from webhook invocations can be found from the [apps](https://modal.com/apps) page.

The indexed contents can be found at <https://www.algolia.com/apps/APP_ID/explorer/browse/>, for your
APP\_ID. Once you’re happy with the results, you can [set up the `docsearch` package with your
website](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/docsearch-v3/), and create a search component that uses this index.

## Entrypoint for development

To make it easier to test this, we also have an entrypoint for when you run `modal run algolia_indexer.py`

```shiki
@app.local_entrypoint()
def run():
 crawl.remote()
```
