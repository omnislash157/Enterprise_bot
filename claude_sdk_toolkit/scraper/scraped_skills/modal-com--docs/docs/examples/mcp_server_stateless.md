This example demonstrates how to deploy a simple [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) on Modal.

The server provides a tool to get the current date and time in a given timezone.
It is a stateless MCP server, meaning that it does not store any state between requests,
which is important for mapping onto Modal’s serverless Functions.
It uses the “streamable HTTP” transport type.

## Building the MCP server

First, we define our dependencies.

We use the [FastMCP library](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) to create the MCP
server. We wrap with a FastAPI server to expose it to the Internet.

```shiki
import modal

app = modal.App("example-mcp-server-stateless")

image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12").uv_pip_install(
 "fastapi==0.115.14",
 "fastmcp==2.10.6",
 "pydantic==2.11.10",
)
```

 

Copy

Next, we create the MCP server itself using FastMCP and add a tool to it that
allows LLMs to get the current date and time in a given timezone.

```shiki
def make_mcp_server():
 from fastmcp import FastMCP

 mcp = FastMCP("Date and Time MCP Server")

 @mcp.tool()
 async def current_date_and_time(timezone: str = "UTC") -> str:
 """Get the current date and time.

 Args:
 timezone: The timezone to get the date and time in (optional). Defaults to UTC.

 Returns:
 The current date and time in the given timezone, in ISO 8601 format.
 """
 from datetime import datetime
 from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo

 try:
 tz = ZoneInfo(timezone)
 except Exception:
 raise ValueError(
 f"Invalid timezone '{timezone}'. Please use a valid timezone like 'UTC', "
 "'America/New_York', or 'Europe/Stockholm'."
 )
 return datetime.now(tz).isoformat()

 return mcp
```

 

Copy

We then use FastMCP to create a Starlette app with `streamable-http` as transport
type, and set `stateless_http=True` to make it stateless.

This will be mounted by the FastAPI app, which we deploy as a [Modal web endpoint](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks) using [the `asgi_app` decorator](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.asgi_app):

```shiki
@app.function(image=image)
@modal.asgi_app()
def web():
 """ASGI web endpoint for the MCP server"""
 from fastapi import FastAPI

 mcp = make_mcp_server()
 mcp_app = mcp.http_app(transport="streamable-http", stateless_http=True)

 fastapi_app = FastAPI(lifespan=mcp_app.router.lifespan_context)
 fastapi_app.mount("/", mcp_app, "mcp")

 return fastapi_app
```

 

Copy

And we’re done!

## Testing the MCP server

Now you can [serve](https://modal.com/docs/reference/cli/serve#modal-serve) the MCP
server by running:

```shiki
modal serve mcp_server_stateless.py
```

 

Copy

Then open the [MCP inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```shiki
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

 

Copy

Enter the URL of the MCP server that was printed by the `modal serve` command above,
suffixed with `/mcp/` (so for example `https://modal-labs-examples--datetime-mcp-server-web-dev.modal.run/mcp/`). Also
make sure to select “Streamable HTTP” as the “Transport Type”.

After connecting and clicking “List Tools” in the “Tools” tab you should see your `current_date_and_time` tool listed, and if you “Run Tool” it should give you the
current date and time in UTC!

To automatically test the MCP server, we spin up a client and have it list the tools.

```shiki
@app.function(image=image)
async def test_tool(tool_name: str | None = None):
 from fastmcp import Client
 from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

 if tool_name is None:
 tool_name = "current_date_and_time"

 transport = StreamableHttpTransport(url=f"{web.get_web_url()}/mcp/")
 client = Client(transport)

 async with client:
 tools = await client.list_tools()

 for tool in tools:
 print(tool)
 if tool.name == tool_name:
 result = await client.call_tool(tool_name)
 print(result.data)
 return

 raise Exception(f"could not find tool {tool_name}")
```

 

Copy

This test is executed by running the script with `modal run`:

```shiki
modal run mcp_server_stateless::test_tool
```

 

Copy

 

## Deploying the MCP server

`modal serve` creates an ephemeral, hot-reloading server,
which is useful for testing and development.

When it’s time to move to production,
you can deploy the server with

```shiki
modal deploy mcp_server_stateless
```
