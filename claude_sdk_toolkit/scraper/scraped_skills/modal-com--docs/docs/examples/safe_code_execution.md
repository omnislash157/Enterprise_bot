# Run arbitrary code in a sandboxed environment

This example demonstrates how to run arbitrary code
in multiple languages in a Modal [Sandbox](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox).

## Setting up a multi-language environment

Sandboxes allow us to run any kind of code in a safe environment.
We’ll use an image with a few different language runtimes to demonstrate this.

```shiki
import modal

image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.11").apt_install(
 "nodejs", "ruby", "php"
)
app = modal.App.lookup("example-safe-code-execution", create_if_missing=True)
```

 

Copy

We’ll now create a Sandbox with this image. We’ll also enable output so we can see the image build
logs. Note that we don’t pass any commands to the Sandbox, so it will stay alive, waiting for us
to send it commands.

```shiki
with modal.enable_output():
 sandbox = modal.Sandbox.create(app=app, image=image)

print(f"Sandbox ID: {sandbox.object_id}")
```

 

Copy

 

## Running bash, Python, Node.js, Ruby, and PHP in a Sandbox

We can now use [`Sandbox.exec`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Sandbox#exec) to run a few different
commands in the Sandbox.

```shiki
bash_ps = sandbox.exec("echo", "hello from bash")
python_ps = sandbox.exec("python", "-c", "print('hello from python')")
nodejs_ps = sandbox.exec("node", "-e", 'console.log("hello from nodejs")')
ruby_ps = sandbox.exec("ruby", "-e", "puts 'hello from ruby'")
php_ps = sandbox.exec("php", "-r", "echo 'hello from php';")

print(bash_ps.stdout.read(), end="")
print(python_ps.stdout.read(), end="")
print(nodejs_ps.stdout.read(), end="")
print(ruby_ps.stdout.read(), end="")
print(php_ps.stdout.read(), end="")
print()
```

 

Copy

The output should look something like

```shiki
hello from bash
hello from python
hello from nodejs
hello from ruby
hello from php
```

 

Copy

We can use multiple languages in tandem to build complex applications.
Let’s demonstrate this by piping data between Python and Node.js using bash. Here
we generate some random numbers with Python and sum them with Node.js.

```shiki
combined_process = sandbox.exec(
 "bash",
 "-c",
 """python -c 'import random; print(\" \".join(str(random.randint(1, 100)) for _ in range(10)))' |
 node -e 'const readline = require(\"readline\");
 const rl = readline.createInterface({input: process.stdin});
 rl.on(\"line\", (line) => {
 const sum = line.split(\" \").map(Number).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
 console.log(`The sum of the random numbers is: ${sum}`);
 rl.close();
 });'""",
)

result = combined_process.stdout.read().strip()
print(result)
```

 

Copy

For long-running processes, you can use stdout as an iterator to stream the output.

```shiki
slow_printer = sandbox.exec(
 "ruby",
 "-e",
 """
 10.times do |i|
 puts "Line #{i + 1}: #{Time.now}"
 STDOUT.flush
 sleep(0.5)
 end
 """,
)

for line in slow_printer.stdout:
 print(line, end="")
```

 

Copy

This should print something like

```shiki
Line 1: 2024-10-21 15:30:53 +0000
Line 2: 2024-10-21 15:30:54 +0000
...
Line 10: 2024-10-21 15:30:58 +0000
```

 

Copy

Since Sandboxes are safely separated from the rest of our system,
we can run very dangerous code in them!

```shiki
sandbox.exec("rm", "-rfv", "/", "--no-preserve-root")
```

 

Copy

This command has deleted the entire filesystem, so we can’t run any more commands.
Let’s terminate the Sandbox to clean up after ourselves.

```shiki
sandbox.terminate()
```
