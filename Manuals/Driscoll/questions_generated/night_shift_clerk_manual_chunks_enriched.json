      "content": "Night Shift Clerk Manual\n\nOverview\n\nClerks during the night shift are the central coordinators of warehouse operations. They manage label distribution, weight entry, shorts handling, and workflow tracking, ensuring pickers, loaders, and hi-lo operators can perform their tasks efficiently. The clerks\u2019 performance directly impacts the productivity and accuracy of the entire night shift.\n\nNight shift clerks typically work from 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM until the end of the shift (around 4:00 AM). One clerk starts at 3:00 PM to prepare labels and have the system ready for the start of picking.\n\nShift Schedule and Breaks\n\nClerks follow the standard night shift breaks with slight adjustments:\n\nTwo 15-minute breaks\n\nOne 30-minute lunch break\n\nBreak times are staggered to ensure that at least three clerks are always at the window, keeping operations from falling behind.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nThe night clerk team is divided into specialized roles that ensure smooth workflow:\n\nWeight Entry Clerk (Jessica\u2019s Role)\n\nInputs weights reported by pickers into Telnet.\n\nAccurate weight entry is critical because product weight determines billing.\n\nErrors in weight input can result in incorrect sales and revenue loss.\n\nCoordinates with pickers to verify weights and ensure system accuracy.\n\nDistribution Clerk Order\n\nPrint labels and distribute orders to pickers.\n\nResponsible for maintaining shift timing by ensuring all pickers receive their orders efficiently.\n\nMemorize picker IDs to speed up data entry.\n\nConnect picker IDs to APT for real-time tracking of each pick and productivity measurement\n\nEnsures that labels are scanned and tracked properly.\n\nLabel Preparation Clerk\n\nPrints labels and splits them pallet by pallet for distribution.\n\nEnsures labels match correct orders to prevent mis-picks or shorted orders.\n\nMaintains organization so other clerks can distribute labels accurately.\n\nWorkflow Tracking Clerk\n\nMonitors shift progress and updates spreadsheet reports to track workflow.\n\nKeeps the shift on pace by communicating with other clerks and coordinating tasks.",
