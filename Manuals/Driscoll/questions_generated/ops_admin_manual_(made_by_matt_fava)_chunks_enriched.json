Any assignments that have other items called in remove them from the list. Any that don\u2019t have any items called in were not called in the batches were not called in\n\nGood afternoon,\n\nPlease see attached for the Lucas picks reports filtered to show batches not called in. There were 154 Dry, 248 cooler, and 79 Freezer batches not called in. All batches should be called into Lucas even if a Jennifer device is not being used to select the batch.\n\nChecker report\n\nCannot paste these formulas you have to rewrite them\n\nFor routes with number of pallets listed\n\n=SUM(SUMIFS('Lucas Picks'!I82:I36377,'Lucas Picks'!M82:M36377,Sheet2!A81,'Lucas Picks'!N82:N36377,TEXTSPLIT(B81,\",\")))\n\nFor routes with Full written in\n\n=SUMIF('Lucas Picks'!M38:M36849,Sheet6!A121,'Lucas Picks'!I38:I36849)\n\nAfter separating by temp zone in the checker sheet, use these formulas based on Temp zone\n\n=SUMIFS('Lucas Picks'!I2:I28545,'Lucas Picks'!M2:M28545,Sheet1!A4,'Lucas Picks'!P2:P28545,\"Refer\")\n\n=SUMIFS('Lucas Picks'!I27:I28570,'Lucas Picks'!M27:M28570,Sheet1!A29,'Lucas Picks'!P27:P28570,\"Dry\")\n\n=SUMIFS('Lucas Picks'!I46:I28589,'Lucas Picks'!M46:M28589,Sheet1!A48,'Lucas Picks'!P46:P28589,\"Freezer\")\n\nM col is routes, I is qty picked, N is stops sheet2!A# is the cell in col A for this row\n\nYou will need the checking sheet, Pallet summary sheet and Lucas Pick from the date you are running this report for.",
