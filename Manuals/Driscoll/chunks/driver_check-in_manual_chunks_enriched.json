Once verified, invoices are placed in a rolling cart. When full, the cart is delivered to Invoice Cleaning so that credits, adjustments, and billing can be finalized.\n\nEnd-of-Day Protocol\n\nTwo Driver Check-In team members remain on duty until transportation confirms whether remaining drivers have cases returning. If drivers have returns, the team must remain until those cases are processed and placed appropriately. If not, transportation instructs those drivers to submit invoices directly to Invoice Cleaning, allowing the Driver Check-In team to close out.\n\nAll pallets, equipment, and paperwork must be organized and accounted for before departure.",
