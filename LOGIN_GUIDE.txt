DRISCOLL ENTERPRISE BOT - LOGIN GUIDE
================================================================================

This guide explains how authentication and access control works for the
Driscoll Enterprise Bot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO LOG IN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. MICROSOFT SSO (RECOMMENDED)

   Click "Sign in with Microsoft" on the login page.

   - You'll be redirected to Microsoft's login page
   - Sign in with your @driscollfoods.com account
   - Microsoft handles password, MFA, etc.
   - You're redirected back to the app, logged in

   That's it. No separate password to remember.

2. EMAIL FALLBACK (LEGACY)

   If Microsoft SSO isn't working, you can enter your email directly.
   This is for demo/testing purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST TIME USERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you log in for the first time:

1. Your account is created automatically
2. You start with NO department access
3. An admin (super user or dept head) must grant you access

This is by design - we don't guess what you should have access to based on
your email address. Access is explicitly granted by administrators.

WHAT TO DO:
- Contact your department head or IT admin
- They'll grant you access via the Admin Portal
- Once granted, you'll see your departments on next login

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNDERSTANDING YOUR ACCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After logging in, you'll see:

  Email:        your.name@driscollfoods.com
  Role:         user / dept_head / super_user
  Departments:  [list of departments you can access]

ROLES:
  user        - Standard access to granted departments
  dept_head   - Can manage users in their department
  super_user  - Full admin access to everything

DEPARTMENTS:
  You only see data for departments you've been granted access to.
  Common departments: warehouse, sales, credit, transportation, purchasing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR ADMINISTRATORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GRANTING ACCESS (Admin Portal):

1. Log in with your admin account
2. Go to Admin Portal (gear icon or /admin)
3. Find the user by email
4. Click "Grant Access"
5. Select department and access level
6. Save

ACCESS LEVELS:
  read   - View department data only
  write  - View and modify department data
  admin  - Full department control

MAKING SOMEONE A DEPT HEAD:
  Only super_users can assign the dept_head role.
  Go to user profile > Change Role > dept_head

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"No departments available"
  -> You haven't been granted access yet
  -> Contact your admin or dept head

"Email domain not authorized"
  -> You're using a non-driscoll email
  -> Microsoft SSO should only allow @driscollfoods.com

"Token expired"
  -> Your session timed out
  -> Refresh the page or log in again

Can't access a specific department?
  -> You don't have a grant for that department
  -> Contact the dept head for that department

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECURITY NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Authentication is handled by Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- We don't store your password - Microsoft handles that
- All access grants are logged in an audit trail
- Session tokens expire for security
- MFA is enforced by your Microsoft tenant policy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For access requests:
  -> Contact your department head
  -> Or email IT support

For technical issues:
  -> Check the troubleshooting section above
  -> Contact IT support if problem persists
