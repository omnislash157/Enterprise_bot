================================================================================
PICKING
================================================================================

Role: Retrieve products from warehouse slots and build pallets for delivery

WORKFLOW:
1. Clock in, change in locker room, get jack from machine room
2. Report to window - clerk enters employee ID
3. Receive list of labels from clerk
4. Jennifer voice system directs to slot locations
5. Pick cases, verify case matches label and slot
6. Build pallet (heavy cases bottom, light cases top)
7. Wrap pallet in saran wrap when complete
8. Deliver to designated door for loaders
9. Return to window for next label set

PRODUCTIVITY TIPS:
- Keep 10-12 extra pallets nearby for efficiency

- Dry zone does not require weights

PERFORMANCE:
- Paid hourly with incentive bonuses above 100% productivity
- Mispicks negatively impact company and individual bonuses
- Approximately 95,000 cases processed nightly
- Faster/accurate completion = earlier shift end

================================================================================
CHECKING
================================================================================

Role: Last quality control before orders leave warehouse

WORKFLOW:
1. Receive order sheets from clerks at check window
2. Review orders pallet by pallet, case by case
3. Verify physical product matches printed order (not just labels)
4. Mark missing, incorrect, or extra items on sheet
5. Report discrepancies to clerks immediately
6. Clear checked pallets for loaders

PRIORITY ORDERS:
1. Connecticut (CT) Routes - checked first (earliest morning departure)
2. VIP Orders - approximately 130 per night
   - Schools: check thoroughly (wrong/missing cases = fines)
   - High-priority customers

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Check physical product AND label (label errors occur)
- Errors cause customer dissatisfaction, returns, fines
- Checkers are last line of defense before delivery

EFFICIENCY:
- Loaders depend on checkers to clear pallets quickly

Role: Load checked pallets onto trucks in correct sequence

WORKFLOW:

2. Clerk assigns next available truck door
3. Verify all pallets for order are present at door
4. Check route and stop information on labels

- Single-layer pallets: no strapping required
- Rewrap any insecure pallets before loading

EXECUTION:
1. Use jack to move pallets into truck following stop sequence
2. Verify all pallets on sheet are loaded
3. Do NOT mix routes - each truck contains only its assigned deliveries
4. Return paperwork to clerk when complete
5. Receive next loading assignment

PERFORMANCE:
- Paid per pallet loaded
- Misloads negatively impact pay and company performance
- Balance speed with precision

FLOOR FLOW:
- Slow loading congests floor with pallets
